- [x] When doing Dotprompt, make the package version accessible from the prompt context
- [x] Make `dotguides create` to bootstrap a `.guides` folder in the current directory.
- [x] Implement commands.
- [x] Implement support for Go.
- [ ] Implement support for Python.
- [ ] Implement CLI commands to make testing things easier. Maybe `dotguides preview [--package <name>] <resource_type> <name> <...optional_args>` or something.
- [ ] A `dotguides install` that installs contrib guidance where detected for the project.
- [ ] A `dotguides customize [-g] <package_name>` command that allows the user to create per-workspace or user-global guidance for a package. Copies the existing data (if any) and then can be customized.
- [ ] An `upgrade` guide that walks the user through a major version upgrade of the package.
- [ ] Make `dotguides up` automate the setup process of detecting the correct agent, adding workflows etc. as possible (since MCP workflows aren't always supported). This should also prompt the user to install any discovered contrib guidance that matches their packages.
- [ ] Open question: should Dotguides only be for packages or should it also work for general workspaces? Probably the latter -- imagine `setup` is basically like an onboarding guide for a repo.
- [ ] Maybe have a way to allow libraries to "detect" whether they've already been setup through a simple file existence check or a regex code search.
- [ ] Make it easy to embed resources via Dotprompt, so the setup guide can include certain docs for example.
- [ ] Support `~/.guides/{lang}/{package}` for custom contrib guides. Question: are these overrides or fallbacks?
- [ ] Support `~/.guides/aliases.json` for some kind of custom aliasing (e.g. load guidance for `foo` package from `my-custom-foo-guides` package).
- [ ] When reading a doc with children (e.g. reading `docs:mypackage:foo` when `docs:mypackage:foo/bar` exists), automatically list child docs at the end of the content.
- [ ] Implement examples -- pull code snippets and have frontmatter able to be defined in top-of-file comment blocks
- [ ] Make `dotguides up` interactive where you can choose which packages you want to activate, toggle MCP servers on and off, etc. Store that configuration in `.guides/settings.json`.
- [ ] Make `dotguides up` compatible with Claude Code, Cursor, Copilot, and Codex.
- [ ] Come up with a way to add dotguides guidance from websites, like having a `/.well-known/.guides/config.json` file or something. MUST have a `config.json` and all content must be explicitly declared in the config file.
- [ ] Have `dotguides mcp --author` that starts an MCP server in a special "author" mode that can help authors inspect and test out their content.
- [ ] Improve security of remote URL guidance by downloading only once per version, maybe add the ability to have a content hash? Though that would sort of defeat the purpose.
