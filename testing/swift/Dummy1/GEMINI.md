# Project Overview

This is a simple SwiftUI application for iOS, macOS, or other Apple platforms. The project is named "Dummy1" and serves as a basic template or starting point for a SwiftUI app.

The main view, defined in `ContentView.swift`, displays a "Hello, world!" message along with a globe icon. The application entry point is in `Dummy1App.swift`.

## Building and Running

To build and run this project, you will need Xcode.

1.  Open the `Dummy1.xcodeproj` file in Xcode.
2.  Select a simulator or a connected device.
3.  Click the "Run" button (or press Cmd+R).

## Development Conventions

The code is written in Swift and follows the standard SwiftUI application structure.

*   **Views:** SwiftUI views are defined in separate files (e.g., `ContentView.swift`).
*   **App Entry Point:** The main application structure is defined in a file conforming to the `App` protocol (e.g., `Dummy1App.swift`).
*   **Assets:** Images, colors, and other assets are managed in the `Assets.xcassets` catalog.
